# Workshop 1: Introducing JavaScript with P5.js

Collaborators: [your github username] & [your partners github username]

Make sure you‚Äôre working in pairs - on a single laptop. You‚Äôll be **pair
programming**. In pair programming, there are two roles - **driver** and
**navigator**.

The **driver** is at the keyboard. They‚Äôre responsible for typing and figuring
out syntax. They shouldn‚Äôt make decisions though! That‚Äôs the responsibility of
the **navigator**. They make decisions, and ask the driver to implement them.

Start by forking this repo:
![fork button](https://readme-pics.s3.amazonaws.com/fork_button.jpg)

Forking creates a copy of this repo in your own GitHub account. Add your partner
as a collaborator by going to 'Settings' > 'Collaborators & teams' and entering
their GitHub username in the 'Collaborators' box. That means you'll both have
access to the repo.

You should now have a copy of this git repository in your own github account.
Now, we need to get a copy on our own laptop for us to work with. Start by
opening a terminal and creating a projects/ada folder if you don't already have
one:

```sh
cd Desktop
mkdir Projects
cd Projects
```

Next, we need to clone the repo. This copies all the files and history from
github to our own computer:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/<your github username>/di-workshop-01-intro-to-p5.git
cd di-workshop-01-intro-to-p5
```

You can see that it's a git repository and some of the history by running these
commands:

```sh
git status
git log
```

> **Note:** If you get stuck in `git log`, it's because you're in something
> called a pager. This is a really old bit of software from before computers
> could scroll in the way we're used to. You can move up and down in the pager
> with your arrow keys, and exit it by pressing `q`

Finally, we need to install some bits and pieces that in our new repo to finish
setting it up:

```sh
npm install
```

---

We‚Äôll be working with some software called P5. P5 is a **JavaScript library**
for drawing shapes - it‚Äôs used for making simple games and cool generative art.

For each of the **bold** questions below:

<h3 align="center">
  üó£ Discuss &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  üë©‚Äçüíª Change &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  üëÄ Observe &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  üîÑ Repeat
</h3>

1. **üó£ Discuss** the question with your partner
1. **üë©‚Äçüíª Change the code** - what do you expect your changes to do?
1. **üëÄ Observe the results** - what happened when you ran your code? How did it
   differ from your expectations
1. **üîÑ Repeat** - keep discussing, changing, and running the code until you
   feel you understand it

**The aim of this workshop is _exploration_, hopefully leading to
_understanding_. It‚Äôs really important that you _take your time_. The questions
below are _guidelines_, meant to prompt your _curiosity_. If you can‚Äôt answer a
question, use a search engine or ask someone nearby. Don‚Äôt move on until you
_fully understand_ what‚Äôs happening.**

**Explore and have fun! Be curious!**

# Setup

Now you've got the repo cloned and installed, we need to start it up:

```sh
npm start
```

This runs a web server - a little program that your browser can connect to so
that the files you write in this project can run in there. Now, when you visit
http://localhost:5000/, you'll see all your files right there.

Open the workshop folder in your editor. In VSCode, choose File > Open and
select the folder - _not any of the files inside it_. You should see all the
workshop files in the left-hand file pane.

Open this file - README.md - in your editor. Make notes in here about everything
you do. If you don't know the answer to a question, it's your job to experiment
with the code to see what you can find out.

# Sketch A

Open the `part-a` sketch in your browser, and open `part-a/sketch.js` in your
editor. The code in `sketch.js` is what's running on the page. Every time you
make a change in `sketch.js`, you need to save the file (ctrl-S or cmd-S) and
refresh your web browser (ctrl-r or cmd-r) to see the change.

---

Look at these lines:

```js
var r = 255
var g = 80
var b = 0
```

**What might these lines do?**
variables that are being defined to be used in a function. function uses variables to create hexadecimal numbers to change the colour of a canvas box.
**What happens if you change the numbers?**
the colour of the canvas box changes.
**What numbers are allowed / What numbers have an effect?**
anythijng between 0 nand 255, anything else doen not take affect - maybe black

Look at this line:

```js
createCanvas(400, 400)
```

**What does createCanvas do?**
creates a box for drawing in.
**What happens if you change the numbers?**
The canvas box changes size.
**What numbers are allowed/what numbers have an effect?**
positive numbers (zero to infinite)
**What happens if you add/remove a number?**
the function will not execute - error code should come up.


**Can you guess what the `function setup() {` part does? What happens if you
change the name of setup?**

Look at this line:

```js
background(r, g, b)
```

**What does background do?**
sets the colour of the backround.

**What happens if you change the order of the letters in background? What does
this tell you about how the computer uses them?**
colour mix changes when you change the order of the variables.
**What happens if you change the number of letters?**
the function will not execute - error code (wrong number of arguments)

**What happens if you change the letters for different ones?**
the function will not run - error code

# Sketch B

Open the `part-b` sketch in your browser, and open `part-b/sketch.js` in your
editor.

Read the code and play with the sketch in your browser.

> **Note**: There's two main sections in the code - the bit called `setup` and
> the bit called `draw`. The code in the `setup` section runs **once**, when
> your program first starts up. The code in the `draw` section runs again and
> again and again - 60 times every second.

Look at these lines:

```js
function setup() {
  createCanvas(400, 400)
  background(0, 0, 0)
}
```

**What does setup do?**
it creates a black canvas for the user to draw on.
**What do `{` `}` mean? What happens if you remove one?**
Everything put between the "{" and "}" is the command that ia executed by the function.


**What do the numbers in `background(0, 0, 0)` do? What happens when you change
them? How is this different from Sketch A?**
the backround colour is still being set using numbers to select colours colours but this time they are being set directly without first storing them into variables.

Now look at these lines:

```js
function draw() {
  fill(255, 0, 0)
  ellipse(mouseX, mouseY, 30, 30)
}
```

**What does draw do?**
draw allows the user to draw onto the canvas created in the setup function.

Now look at:

```js
fill(255, 0, 0)
```

**What do these numbers do? What happens when you change them?**
uses numbers to determin how many pixles of each colour to make a colour for the draw function.

**What does fill mean? What happens if you change it to stroke?**
it changes the colout from the inside of the draw function to the outine of the draw function.


**What happens if you remove (or comment out) this line? 

the outline goes black and the fill colour is white (default?)

What about if you
include both fill and stroke on seperate lines?**

the stroke sets the outline colour and the fill sets the inside if the draw function.

Now look at this line:

```js
ellipse(mouseX, mouseY, 30, 30)
```

**What does `ellipse` do?**
ellipse draws a circular image.

**What happens if you change the numbers?**
it changes the size of the elipse.

**What do `mouseX` and `mouseY` mean?**
sets the co-ordinates of the ellipse at the current co-ordinate of the mouse within the canvas grid.

**What happens if you change the order of the items between the `(` `)`?**
(e.g. 30, 30, mouseX, mouseY)
would set a fixed position of the pointer at 30 pixles from the left and 30 pixles from the top. the size would the be set depending on the current position of the mouse within the canvas.
---

**What happens if you add `background(0)` after `draw() {`? Why?**
it changes the colour of the whole canvas to black.


Replace the ellipse with a triangle. Use https://p5js.org/reference/ (the 2D
primitives section) to help.
DONE!

Play around with the sketch - how else can you change it?

you can set one of the points of the triangle so that it is equal to the position of the mouse pointer.

# Sketch C

Open the `part-c` sketch in your browser, and open `part-c/sketch.js` in your
editor.

Read the code, then play with the sketch and observe what happens - try clicking
the mouse on the sketch.

Look at:

```js
if (mouseIsPressed) {
  fill(255, 0, 0)
} else {
  fill(0, 255, 0)
}
```

**What does `mouseIsPressed` mean?**
is it an event listener? if statement set to the condition of, if mouse is pressed - do this! else - do that!

**What happens if you change `mouseIsPressed` to `keyIsPressed`?** You‚Äôll need
to click on the sketch so it registers keyboard events ‚Äì use the ctrl key if you
have issues with the keyboard.
changes the (condition) event listener to keyboard events.

**What does if / else do?**
if else is a conditional statement/controle function - e.g. if this is true - do this. else, if that is true - do that.

**What happens if you remove the { } or ( )? Why?**
the program did not execute, error message comes up in the console. a conditional statement needs parenthesis to determin what the condition is.

**What happens if you change 255 to mouseX ? Why?**

The canvas screen is faded/darkened on the left hand side.

**Remove the outline of the circle. Use Google and the P5.js reference to help
you.**

You can set the stroke/outline colour the same as the fill colour! or just use the noStroke(); function

# Challenge

In your pairs, take the code in sketch c and adapt it into a simple paint
program. The user should be able

- click and drag to paint on the screen
- press keys on the keyboard to choose a colour
  - e.g. pressing ‚Äòr‚Äô changes the paint colour to red, pressing ‚Äòg‚Äô changes the
    paint colour to green.

Use this code as a starting point:

```js
if (keyIsPressed) {
  if (key == 'r') {
    // set paint colour to red
  }
  if (key == 'g') {
    // set paint colour to green
  }
  // add more keys/colours
}
```

**Document your process in this file.**

## Extension

- Change the shape of the brush (explore other shapes like squares or triangles)
  based on a key pressed
- Change the size of the brush based on a key pressed.
